## Learning Path

It's recommended to complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. Start with basic slicing and array manipulation (0-5)
2. Progress to matrix operations (6-9)
3. Advance to scaling, normalization, and complex transformations (10-14)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization tasks if applicable)

## Running Exercises

To run any exercise:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **Array Indexing & Slicing**: Accessing and extracting elements from arrays
- **Matrix Operations**: Multiplication, transposition, and transformations
- **Vector Spaces**: Understanding linear combinations and transformations
- **Normalization**: Scaling data to unit norm or specific ranges
- **Eigenanalysis**: Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrix analysis

## Notes

- All exercises use NumPy for efficient numerical computations
- Many exercises build upon concepts from previous ones
- Focus on understanding the mathematical concepts behind each operation
- Test edge cases and validate results where possible
